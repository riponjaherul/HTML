## HTML

 - HTML5 does not require empty elements(`<br>`) to be closed. But if you want stricter validation, or if you need to make your document readable by XML parsers, you must close all HTML elements properly.
 - HTML tags are not case sensitive ` <P>` means the same as `<p>`.
 - The HTML5 standard does not require lowercase tags, but W3C **recommends** lowercase in HTML, and **demands** lowercase for stricter document types like XHTML.
 - **Attribute** : HTML links are defined with the `<a>` tag. The link address is specified in the `href` attribute
 - The HTML `<head>` element is a container for metadata. HTML metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed. `<meta charset="UTF-8">`
