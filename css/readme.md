## CSS

 - Do not add a space between the property value and the unit (such as `margin-left: 20 px;`). The correct way is: `margin-left: 20px;`
 - An inline style loses many of the advantages of a style sheet (by mixing content with presentation). Use this method sparingly.
 - All the styles in a page will "cascade" into a new "virtual" style sheet by the following rules, where number one has the highest priority:	
		 - Inline style (inside an HTML element)
		 - External and internal style sheets (in the head section)
		 - Browser default
